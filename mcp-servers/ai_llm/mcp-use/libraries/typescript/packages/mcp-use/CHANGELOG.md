# mcp-use

## 1.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 430178c: feat(server): enforce `outputSchema` at the tool return position, and make templates score 100% on the publishing checklist (MCP-2260)
  - `mcp-use`: a tool's `outputSchema` is now type-checked at the return position with no new API. Returning `object({...})` (or `widget({ props })`, whose props become the result's `structuredContent`) with a shape that does not match `outputSchema` is a compile-time error, while content-only helpers (`text()`, `markdown()`, `image()`, ...) are always allowed. This is achieved by typing content helpers as a new `ToolContentResult` (no `structuredContent`) and making `widget()` generic over its props. Note: returning `mix()` carrying structured content, or a raw object literal whose `structuredContent` does not match, against a tool that declares `outputSchema` now errors (use `object()` or align the shape).
  - `mcp-use`: the Apps SDK adapter auto-derives `openai/widgetDescription` from the widget's `description` when it isn't set explicitly, so hosts (and the publishing checklist) always see a widget description.
  - `create-mcp-use-app` (`starter`): `fetch-weather` declares a `title` and an `outputSchema`, returning matching `structuredContent` via `object()`.
  - `create-mcp-use-app` (`mcp-apps`): `search-tools` and `get-fruit-details` declare a `title`, and the `product-search-result` widget declares a `domain` (widget description is auto-derived from its `description`).

### Patch Changes

- 430178c: fix(inspector): default connections to Auto mode with proxy fallback

  The Inspector connection form no longer asks users to choose between Direct and
  Via Proxy before connecting. New connections use Auto mode by default: the
  Inspector tries a direct browser connection first, then falls back to the
  configured Inspector proxy when direct connection fails because of CORS or other
  proxy-resolvable connection errors.

  Direct and Proxy are still available as advanced connection mode overrides in
  the Configuration dialog, alongside the editable Proxy Endpoint. The Inspector
  also preserves legacy `connectionType` configs while writing the new
  `connectionMode` field.

  `useMcp` now applies the runtime proxy config after automatic fallback when it
  derives gateway URLs and headers, so fallback retries route through the proxy
  instead of continuing to use the original direct transport config.

- 430178c: Updated dependency `vite` to `^8.0.16`.
- 430178c: exposed the cwd argument for stdio
- 430178c: Bump hono from 4.12.23 to 4.12.25.
- 430178c: Use the MCP Apps bridge as the primary widget runtime even when `window.openai` is present, while keeping OpenAI extension APIs such as file upload and download available through `useFiles`.
- 430178c: fix(inspector): scope OAuth proxy fetch per server configuration

  The browser OAuth provider previously installed a global `window.fetch`
  interceptor to route OAuth requests through the inspector proxy. With multiple
  servers, connecting one server "Via Proxy" mutated `fetch` for the entire page,
  so other servers (including ones set to "Direct") and unrelated requests were
  affected, and switching a server from "Via Proxy" back to "Direct" could leave a
  stale interceptor behind.

  `BrowserOAuthClientProvider` now exposes a scoped `getProxyFetch()` that returns
  a `fetch` confined to a single provider. It is passed only to that server's SDK
  transport and `auth()` calls (via the SDK's `fetch` / `fetchFn` options), so
  OAuth-proxy behavior is scoped to the selected server's connection and the
  global `fetch` is never mutated.

- 430178c: Fix `useWidget` breaking Apps SDK-only widgets. The MCP Apps bridge remains the primary runtime, but `window.openai` (Apps SDK) is now used as a compatibility fallback when the bridge does not connect, instead of being dropped entirely. Previously, any widget iframe whose host only spoke the Apps SDK (e.g. a ChatGPT widget without MCP Apps support) stayed stuck on the loading spinner because `useWidget` ignored `window.openai` data. A connected MCP Apps bridge still always wins, so ChatGPT continues to use MCP Apps as the source of truth.

## 1.32.1

### Patch Changes

- efa7fe7: Updated dependency `esbuild` to `0.28.1`.
- efa7fe7: Fix OAuth metadata discovery for authorization servers with path-suffix issuers (RFC 8414). Construct the upstream OAuth and OpenID metadata URLs correctly and additionally mount the canonical `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server{issuer-path}` route. Closes #1576.
- efa7fe7: OAuth proxy mode now brokers the upstream callback through the server's own `/oauth/callback` instead of forwarding each MCP client's redirect URI upstream. Register a single redirect URI on your OAuth provider — `<your-server-domain>/oauth/callback` — and every MCP client (Claude, ChatGPT, the inspector, ...) can authenticate without registering its own callback. The client's redirect URI and state are carried statelessly through the upstream `state` parameter, PKCE stays end-to-end between the client and the upstream, and `/token` rewrites `redirect_uri` to match the brokered authorize request.

  If you previously registered client callback URLs (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/inspector/oauth/callback`) on your provider, add `<your-server-domain>/oauth/callback` instead.

- efa7fe7: Add server-side logging for outgoing notifications, printing detailed logs for sent and failed notifications with session identifiers and error details.
- efa7fe7: Silence dev-mode widget startup logs when a project has no widgets. An empty or
  absent `resources/` directory no longer prints the `[WIDGETS]` mounting/serving/
  watching messages. The Vite watcher still starts so widgets created later (e.g.
  Mango/E2B sandboxes) are picked up and logged when they appear.

## 1.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 4d00a1f: fix(react/auth): opener-owned OAuth popup flow so connections never get stuck in "authenticating"

  The browser OAuth popup handoff was fire-and-forget: `authenticate()` opened the
  popup and then relied on a single `mcp_auth_callback` push message from the
  callback page to leave the `authenticating` state. Any lost message (popup
  closed early, severed `window.opener` under COOP, partitioned BroadcastChannel,
  or a provider remount racing the callback) stranded the UI on "Authenticating…"
  until a hard refresh — even though tokens were already persisted.

  Adopt the pattern used by mature browser OAuth libraries (auth0-spa-js,
  oidc-client-ts, msal-browser): the window that opens the popup owns a promise
  that always settles on one of four outcomes.
  - New `runAuthPopup()` helper (exported from `mcp-use/auth`) settles on the
    first of: a `state`-matched result message (postMessage **or**
    BroadcastChannel), the popup being closed, a `storage` event for the flow's
    tokens key (robust to severed/partitioned channels), or a timeout. The close
    and timeout paths check persisted tokens before declaring
    cancelled/timeout, so a "missed message but tokens landed" case still
    succeeds.
  - `useMcp().authenticate()` now awaits `runAuthPopup()` and owns every state
    transition: success reconnects, cancelled/timeout return to `pending_auth`
    (re-enabling the Authenticate button), and error fails the connection.
  - The OAuth callback page stamps result payloads with the originating `state`
    and `serverUrlHash`. The always-on callback listener now scopes results to
    the right server and won't clobber an already-`ready` connection with a late
    failure message.

  fix(react): stop wiping OAuth credentials on routine lifecycle churn

  Persisted OAuth credentials (tokens / client_info / PKCE verifier) are user
  state, not connection state, and were being destroyed by ordinary lifecycle
  events — silently logging users out and (when a popup completed after a
  remount) breaking the flow entirely.
  - `McpClientProvider`'s `removeServer(id)` no longer clears OAuth storage by
    default. Pass `removeServer(id, { clearCredentials: true })` for an explicit
    logout / "forget this server" action (the Inspector's delete-server button
    now does). This is a behavior change to `removeServer`; the signature stays
    backward compatible.
  - `updateServer()` no longer clears OAuth storage — editing options is not a
    logout. It still remounts to apply the new options.
  - `useMcp` no longer wipes OAuth storage on unmount mid-flow. Stale
    authorization state records already expire via their 10-minute TTL and the
    PKCE verifier is overwritten on the next auth start, so a popup completing
    after a wrapper remount now lands cleanly.

### Patch Changes

- 4d00a1f: Move chalk from optionalDependencies to dependencies. It is statically imported by server code (`src/server/logging.ts`, `src/server/utils/server-lifecycle.ts`), so installs that skip optional packages (`pnpm install --no-optional`, `npm config set optional false`) would fail at module load.

- f9fb29b: Downgrade chalk to v4 to fix CJS builds. chalk 5 is ESM-only and is kept external by tsup, so the CJS bundle's `require("chalk")` on Node ≥ 22 returned the module namespace instead of the chalk instance, crashing CJS-built backends (e.g. the Next.js template) on startup with `TypeError: import_chalk.default.gray is not a function`.

### Patch Changes

- c866bda: Fix iframe collapse when widget renders null by allowing zero-height notifications

  Previously, the `height > 0` guard in `McpUseProvider` prevent height notifications when a widget rendered `null`, causing the iframe to persist at its last non-zero height. This fix allows zero heights to pass through unconditionally while maintaining the threshold check for positive heights, enabling proper iframe collapse for empty widgets.

- c866bda: fix(react,client): prevent stale disconnect from wiping a reconnected MCP session

  When `useMcp` reconnects after a URL change (e.g. dashboard environment
  switch), the previous effect's async `disconnect()` could finish after the
  new `connect()` and either:
  1. set `clientRef` to null while React state remained `ready` — surfacing
     as "MCP client is not ready (current state: ready)"; or
  2. wipe the freshly-created session out of the underlying client's session
     map — surfacing as "No active session found" on the next tool call.

  `disconnect()` now only nulls `clientRef` **and** resets the hook state when
  it has not been superseded by a newer `connect()` (a `connectEpochRef` counter
  bumped at the start of each `connect()`, plus a client-identity check). This
  covers both the case where `connect()` reuses the same `BrowserMCPClient`
  instance for the new URL and a manual `disconnect()` racing a reconnect, which
  must not clobber the live connection's state back to `discovering`.

  `BaseMCPClient.closeSession()` now only deletes `sessions[name]` if the slot
  still references the captured session. A parallel `createSession()` from a
  newer `connect()` may have already written a new session there while we were
  awaiting `session.disconnect()`; the previous unconditional `delete` in the
  `finally` block would wipe that new session and break tool calls.

  MCP operation errors also distinguish a missing client from a non-ready
  state.

### Patch Changes

- feb8f09: Updated dependency `vitest` to `^4.1.0`.
- feb8f09: Updated dependency `hono` to `4.12.18`.
- feb8f09: Fix an authentication bypass on OAuth-protected MCP servers. The MCP JSON-RPC handler is mounted on both `/mcp` and `/sse`, but the bearer-auth middleware was only applied to `/mcp/*`, leaving `/sse` reachable without a token. The middleware now also covers `/sse` (and `/sse/*`), and the server advertises RFC 9728 path-scoped protected-resource metadata for `/sse`.
- feb8f09: Resolve all open Dependabot security advisories in the TypeScript workspace. Bumps the `hono` direct dependency to `^4.12.18` and raises the pinned floors in `pnpm.overrides` for `axios`, `protobufjs`, `@protobufjs/utf8`, `ws`, `uuid`, `fast-uri`, `ip-address`, `postcss`, `langsmith`, `follow-redirects`, `dompurify`, `qs`, `react-router`, `vitest`, and `better-auth` so the lockfile resolves to patched versions. All bumps stay within compatible major lines (e.g. `protobufjs` and `uuid` are bounded to their current majors) to avoid breaking changes.

### Minor Changes

- 83271e8: Add `supabaseUrl` override to `oauthSupabaseProvider` so it can point at a local or self-hosted Supabase instance (e.g. `http://localhost:54321`) instead of the hosted `https://${projectId}.supabase.co` URL. Configurable via the new `supabaseUrl` config option or `MCP_USE_OAUTH_SUPABASE_URL` environment variable; `projectId` is now optional when `supabaseUrl` is provided.

### Patch Changes

- 83271e8: Fix built-in inspector auto-connect to use streamable HTTP for the local `/mcp` endpoint instead of SSE.
- 83271e8: Fix OAuth-protected `mcp-use dev` flows by normalizing `0.0.0.0` and `::` to `localhost` in the inspector's autoConnect URL, so it matches the resource metadata published by `getServerBaseUrl()` and passes the SDK's strict origin check.
- 83271e8: Fix double slash in OAuth metadata proxy URL for DCR-direct providers (e.g. `oauthAuth0Provider`) by normalizing the issuer's trailing slash before appending `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
- 83271e8: Fix browser OAuth popup callback edge cases in `onMcpAuthorization()`:
  - The popup window navigating itself to the dashboard URL when `window.opener` was severed (COOP / cross-origin redirects / browser tab grouping). Detect "is this a popup we opened?" via `window.name.startsWith("mcp_auth_")` and render an in-place close-window message instead of redirecting to `returnUrl`. The genuine popup-blocker / manual-link case (top-level navigation, not a popup window) still redirects to `returnUrl` as before.
  - "Invalid or expired state" surfaced to the parent after a successful flow when `onMcpAuthorization()` was invoked more than once in the same page load (HMR, React strict-mode double invocation, Suspense re-mount). Re-invocations now reuse the original promise via a module-level cache, so they never re-exchange the code or post a stale `success: false` to the opener.
  - The lost-opener popup branch saved tokens but had no way to notify the parent, leaving `useMcp` stuck in `authenticating` until a hard refresh. Both the popup callback and the parent `useMcp` now use a same-origin `BroadcastChannel("mcp_auth_callback")` as a fallback transport when `window.opener.postMessage` is unavailable — matching the pattern used by `oidc-client-ts` and MSAL.js for the same COOP-driven scenario.
  - **`mcp-use/browser` no longer exports LangChain agents** (`MCPAgent`, `RemoteAgent`, adapters, observability, AI SDK utils). Those moved to **`mcp-use/browser/agent`** so client bundles (e.g. Next.js dashboards) that only need `MCPClient` do not pull in `@langchain/*` / `langchain`.

- 83271e8: Fix `McpClientProvider.removeServer` and `McpClientProvider.updateServer` triggering React's "Cannot update a component (`McpServerWrapper`) while rendering a different component (`McpClientProvider`)" warning whenever a wrapper is torn down.

  Both methods invoked `server.disconnect()` and `server.clearStorage()` _inside_ a `setServers((prev) => …)` updater. React 18+ runs updater functions during the render phase of the component that owns the state, and both wrapper callbacks make synchronous setState calls on the wrapper itself — `setLog` via `addLog("info", "Disconnecting…")` (the very first sync line of `disconnect`) and `setAuthUrl(void 0)` inside `clearStorage`. Those setStates landed during `McpClientProvider`'s render phase, producing the warning every time a consumer changed the URL of an existing wrapper or removed one.

  The provider now keeps a `serversRef` mirror of `servers`, captures the wrapper to tear down BEFORE scheduling the state updates, and runs `disconnect()` / `clearStorage()` after the `setServers` / `setServerConfigs` calls return. The updaters are now pure (`(prev) => prev.filter(…)`); the wrapper's synchronous setStates fire from event-handler context and batch normally with the pending provider updates, never crossing into the render phase.

- 83271e8: Treat `name` as a meaningful change in `McpServerWrapper` so alias-only edits propagate through `onUpdate` and the Inspector tile heading reflects the new alias immediately.
- 83271e8: Clarify the "Inspector: Skipped in production" log so users don't try to pass `--with-inspector` to `mcp-use start`. The flag belongs to `mcp-use build`; the new log spells out the rebuild command.

  Docs: added a short note under `start` in `cli-reference.mdx` pointing readers at `build --with-inspector` for production inspector access.

- 83271e8: Prune unused exports flagged by Knip. Removes 187 unused exports and deletes 19 unused source files across packages. No public API changes — only internal helpers and barrel re-exports that no consumer was using were touched.

  Adds a real OAuth flow to the `mcp-use` CLI. `mcp-use client connect <url>`
  against an OAuth-protected MCP server now opens a browser, captures the
  authorization code via a localhost loopback, persists tokens to
  `~/.mcp-use/oauth/<urlHash>/`, and silently refreshes them on subsequent
  commands — no flag plumbing.

  New on `mcp-use`:
  - `mcp-use/auth/node` entrypoint exporting `NodeOAuthClientProvider`,
    `FileKVStore`, the `KVStore` type, and re-exporting the SDK's `auth` and
    `UnauthorizedError`.
  - `NodeOAuthClientProvider` implements `OAuthClientProvider`, owns the
    loopback callback server (preferred port 33418, walks up to 33427 on
    conflict, persisted across runs), and exposes `getAuthorizationCode()`
    for the orchestrator pattern in `useMcp.ts`.
  - `FileKVStore` writes tokens, client info, and code verifiers to one file
    per key under `~/.mcp-use/oauth/<urlHash>/` with `0o600` perms and atomic
    rename on write.

  New on `@mcp-use/cli`:
  - `mcp-use client connect <url>` auto-runs OAuth on `UnauthorizedError`
    when no `--auth` is supplied. New flags: `--no-oauth`, `--auth-timeout`.
  - `mcp-use client auth status|refresh|logout [session]` for token
    introspection, forced refresh, and revocation. (No `auth login` — that's
    what `connect` is for.)
  - Follow-up commands (`tools list`, etc.) on OAuth sessions transparently
    refresh expiring JWTs. If the refresh token itself is dead, the CLI
    prompts to re-auth on TTY or prints the exact `connect` command to run
    on non-TTY.

### Patch Changes

- 46caf80: Remove unused dependencies and devDependencies flagged by `knip`.
  - Root: drop `lint-staged` and `typescript-eslint` (unused; ESLint config uses `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` directly, and Husky pre-commit runs `pnpm format`/`lint:fix` directly without lint-staged). Removed the stale root `lint-staged` config block.
  - `@mcp-use/cli`: drop `globby`, `ws`, `@types/ws` (no source references; `globby` was explicitly replaced by Node built-ins). Removed `globby` from `tsup.config.ts` `noExternal`.
  - `create-mcp-use-app`: drop `fs-extra` and `@types/fs-extra` (no source references).
  - `mcp-use`: drop `ws`, `@types/ws`, `@antfu/eslint-config`, `@langchain/anthropic` (devDep — already an optional peer; only referenced as a string for dynamic import), `eslint-plugin-format`, `lint-staged`. Removed the stale package-level `lint-staged` config block.
  - `knip.json`: ignore `@mcp-use/inspector` for the `cli` package (resolved dynamically via `createRequire().resolve` to read its `package.json`).

  `pnpm knip:deps` now reports 0 unused (dev)dependencies. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` all succeed.

- 46caf80: Updated dependency `next` to `^15.5.18`.
- 46caf80: Make `mcp-use/server` response helpers discoverable to humans and coding agents.
  - **`MCPServer.tool()` JSDoc**: each `@example` block now includes the matching `import { ... } from "mcp-use/server"` line, plus a note that helpers (`text`, `object`, `image`, `markdown`, `html`, `error`, `widget`, …) are exported from `mcp-use/server`. Previously the examples called `text(...)` / `error(...)` with no import, so anyone reading the hover doc had no breadcrumb to the package.
  - **`create-mcp-use-app` blank template**: the commented tool/resource/prompt blocks previously called `text(...)`, `object(...)`, and `z.object(...)` without showing where any of those came from — and the file's top-level imports never referenced them either. Each commented block now includes the relevant `import { ... } from "mcp-use/server"` / `import { z } from "zod"` lines inside the comment, alongside a leading note naming the available response helpers. The template stays truly blank (no tools registered) but the discovery path is now local to the file.

- 46caf80: fix(auth): make `forceRefresh()` actually exchange the refresh_token, and escape HTML in the loopback failure page
  - `NodeOAuthClientProvider.forceRefresh()` now delegates to a new
    `OAuthSessionStore.forceRefresh()` that calls the existing dedup'd
    refresh path directly. The previous implementation tried to coerce a
    refresh by zeroing out `access_token` and re-reading via `tokens()`,
    but `tokens()` gates the refresh path on a truthy `access_token`, so
    no network call was ever made and the stale tokens were returned. This
    is what `mcp-use client auth refresh` runs.
  - The loopback failure page (rendered when the OAuth server redirects
    back with `?error=…`) now HTML-escapes both the `error` code and
    `error_description` rather than only stripping `<>&` from the
    description. Closes a low-severity reflected-XSS in the localhost
    callback page.

- 46caf80: fix(auth): handle SDK-initiated OAuth redirect on 401 in CLI connect

  The SDK's `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` auto-calls `auth()` on a 401, which
  in turn calls our `redirectToAuthorization()` — binding the loopback and
  opening the browser before the transport throws. Two fixes so the CLI's
  `connect` command picks up where the SDK left off instead of dying:
  - `NodeOAuthClientProvider` exposes `hasPendingFlow` so orchestrators can
    detect that the SDK already kicked off the flow and skip straight to
    `getAuthorizationCode()` (calling `auth()` again would throw "an
    authorization is already in progress").
  - `mcp-use client connect`'s `runOAuthFlow` uses `hasPendingFlow` to skip
    the duplicate `auth()` call, and `isUnauthorized` now also matches the
    rewrapped 401 that `HttpConnector` throws (plain `Error` with `code = 401`).

  Without these, the first connect to an OAuth-protected server printed
  "Authentication required" and `process.exit(1)`'d before the browser
  callback returned — leaving the user staring at a "connection refused"
  loopback page.

- 46caf80: refactor(auth): extract `OAuthSessionStore` helper from `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`

  Pulls token storage, JWT-expiry-driven refresh (with deduplication),
  client-info validation, code-verifier handling, key hashing, and generic
  authorization-state persistence into a new platform-neutral
  `OAuthSessionStore` helper parameterized over a `KVStore`. The browser
  provider now holds an `OAuthSessionStore` and delegates the SDK
  `OAuthClientProvider` interface methods to it. No behavior change —
  this prepares the ground for a future Node/CLI OAuth provider.

- 46caf80: Resolved duplicate exports flagged by Knip.
  - Annotated the `Tel` alias for `Telemetry` with the `@alias` directive so Knip no longer flags it as a duplicate export. The alias remains available for consumers.
  - Unified the canonical source path for `Telemetry`, `Tel`, `setTelemetrySource`, and `isBrowserEnvironment` in `src/telemetry/index.ts`. The Node implementation is now the default and is swapped for the browser implementation in browser bundles via the existing tsup substitution plugin.
  - Removed the redundant default export of `JsonRpcLoggerView` in `@mcp-use/inspector`. The named export is unchanged.

- 46caf80: Declare `jsdom` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` as explicit devDependencies (resolves `pnpm knip` unlisted-dependency warnings). `@vitest/coverage-v8` is pinned to `~4.0.18` to match the installed `vitest` and satisfy its exact peer-dep constraint.
- 46caf80: feat(server): print a one-line hint on startup pointing devs at the
  `mcp-use client connect <url>` CLI. Appears in dim gray right after
  the existing `[SERVER] Listening` / `[MCP] Endpoints` lines.

## 1.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 78cfc8a: feat(mcp-use): add Clerk OAuth provider

  Adds `oauthClerkProvider` for using Clerk as an OAuth authorization
  server in MCP servers. Uses DCR-direct mode — MCP clients register and
  authenticate directly with Clerk, and the MCP server verifies
  Clerk-issued JWTs via JWKS.

  Default scopes are `["profile", "email", "offline_access"]`. The
  `openid` scope is excluded by default because it requires OIDC to be
  explicitly enabled in the Clerk Dashboard; users who need it can pass
  `scopesSupported: ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"]`.

- 78cfc8a: Add support for pre-registered OAuth client IDs (proxy mode), including optional client secrets for confidential clients.

  `UseMcpOptions` / `McpServerOptions` now accept an `oauth: { clientId?, clientSecret?, scope? }` field. When `clientId` is provided, `BrowserOAuthClientProvider` returns it from `clientInformation()` so the SDK skips Dynamic Client Registration — required for MCP servers that proxy through providers like Slack or WorkOS, which strip `registration_endpoint` from metadata. When `clientSecret` is also provided, the SDK auto-switches token-endpoint auth from `none` to `client_secret_basic`/`client_secret_post`, which is useful for providers that don't support PKCE. `scope` is forwarded as `clientMetadata.scope`.

  The Inspector's Authentication dialog now has `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Scope` fields, all wired through `addServer` / `updateServer`.

### Patch Changes

- 78cfc8a: fix(inspector): honor `MCP_USE_ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false` for the
  in-browser `useMcp` posthog-js init.

  Previously the env var only disabled Node-side telemetry and the
  inspector's server-side proxy. The `useMcp` React hook still
  initialized `posthog-js` directly in the browser, sending events to
  `https://eu.i.posthog.com` that ad/tracker blockers would flag.

  The inspector server now mirrors the env var into a per-page runtime
  flag (`window.__MCP_USE_ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY__`) before the client
  bundle runs; both `mcp-use`'s browser telemetry and the inspector's
  own client telemetry honor that flag, so a single env var disables
  every telemetry path. The flag is page-scoped — it leaves no
  persistent state, so unsetting the env var fully restores defaults on
  the next page load. Default behavior (telemetry on) is unchanged.

- 1633518: feat(mcp-use): add Clerk OAuth provider

  Adds `oauthClerkProvider` for using Clerk as an OAuth authorization
  server in MCP servers. Uses DCR-direct mode — MCP clients register and
  authenticate directly with Clerk, and the MCP server verifies
  Clerk-issued JWTs via JWKS.

  Default scopes are `["profile", "email", "offline_access"]`. The
  `openid` scope is excluded by default because it requires OIDC to be
  explicitly enabled in the Clerk Dashboard; users who need it can pass
  `scopesSupported: ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"]`.

### Minor Changes

- bdf9182: feat(server): add `MCP_DEBUG_LEVEL` env var with `info` / `debug` / `trace` levels for HTTP request logs

  Replaces the previous all-or-nothing `DEBUG=1` behavior with three explicit verbosity levels:
  - `info` (default): one compact line per request, e.g.
    `[19:44:56] POST /mcp [tools/call: greet] OK (1ms)`. Initialize lines now include the client `name/version` and the new short session id (`→ session=92c4e0b`); subsequent requests are prefixed with `sess=<short>`. JSON-RPC and tool errors are extracted from the response body and shown inline (`ERROR cannot divide by zero`).
  - `debug`: same as `info` plus inline `args=<json>` for `tools/call`.
  - `trace`: identical to the legacy `DEBUG=1` output (full request/response headers and bodies).

  `DEBUG=1` (or any truthy `DEBUG` value) continues to work and maps to `trace`. Internal "Session initialized"/"Session closed" log lines are now suppressed at `info` level, since the per-request log line already conveys that information.

### Patch Changes

- bdf9182: fix(widgets): pre-warm widget Vite entries before registration to prevent first-render `/.vite/deps/*` 504s

  When a widget is registered (initial boot, watcher add-file, or watcher add-folder), `mount-widgets-dev` now calls `viteServer.warmupRequest()` followed by `viteServer.waitForRequestsIdle()` for the widget's `entry.tsx` before exposing it to the inspector. This forces Vite's `depsOptimizer` to finish pre-bundling and stabilise its dependency hash before the browser starts requesting `/.vite/deps/*` modules.

  Previously, the inspector iframe could fetch optimized dependencies (e.g. `mcp-use_react.js`) with a stale Vite hash while `depsOptimizer` was still re-bundling, which surfaced as `504 Gateway Timeout` errors and a blank widget on first interaction in Vibe-created sandboxes. Each widget is warmed at most once per dev-server lifetime; failures fall back to a warning so registration never blocks.

## 1.25.1

### Patch Changes

- 806dbca: Fix OAuth error handling to redirect back to inspector instead of showing raw error page. When OAuth callback receives an error (e.g. user denies access), the callback now looks up the stored state first to retrieve the returnUrl, then redirects back to the inspector with error parameters instead of immediately throwing and displaying a raw error page with stack traces. The inspector surfaces these errors as a persistent App-level toast that fires regardless of the active route.
- 806dbca: Fix Supabase OAuth provider to use OAuth 2.1 server endpoints

  `SupabaseOAuthProvider.getAuthEndpoint()` and `getTokenEndpoint()` now return `/auth/v1/oauth/authorize` and `/auth/v1/oauth/token` — the OAuth 2.1 server paths — instead of the legacy `/auth/v1/authorize` and `/auth/v1/token`. Metadata discovery and JWT verification were already correct, so most DCR-direct clients weren't affected, but any code path that consulted the provider's endpoint getters was pointed at the wrong URLs.

  Also clarifies the Supabase provider docs: adds a `<Steps>` prerequisites block (enable OAuth Server, allow dynamic OAuth apps, set consent URL, pick a sign-in method) and notes that `MCP_USE_OAUTH_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is used by your consent UI and Supabase SDK calls — the provider itself only needs the project ID.

### Minor Changes

- 1bdec92: feat(cli, mcp-use): Next.js drop-in support for MCP servers
  - `mcp-use dev/build/start --mcp-dir <dir>` lets a Next.js app colocate an MCP server (default `src/mcp/`) alongside its routes, sharing the same `@/*` aliases, Tailwind styles, and component library.
  - Auto-shims Next.js server-runtime modules (`server-only`, `client-only`, `next/cache`, `next/headers`, `next/navigation`, `next/server`) when `next` is detected in `package.json`, so tools transitively imported from the app don't blow up outside a Next runtime. Shim list is centralized in `next-shims-registry.json`.
  - Loads Next.js env cascade (`.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`) in the MCP server process.
  - Widget builds fail fast with an actionable error when a widget (or a module it transitively imports) pulls in a Next.js server-only module — widgets run in a browser iframe, so the right fix is to read server data in an MCP tool and pass it through widget props.

- 1bdec92: Refactor OAuth providers to use DCR-direct flow by default

  **Breaking Changes (mcp-use):**
  - Removed proxy mode from built-in OAuth providers (Auth0, WorkOS, Supabase, Keycloak, Better Auth)
  - Built-in providers now only support DCR-direct flow: clients communicate directly with upstream authorization servers
  - `verifyToken` is now an explicit required function for custom providers
  - Provider configurations no longer accept `clientId`/`clientSecret` - use the new `oauthProxy` helper for providers that don't support DCR

  **New Features:**
  - Added `oauthProxy` helper for creating proxy-mode OAuth providers (useful for Google, GitHub, etc.)
  - Added `jwksVerifier` helper function for easy JWKS-based token verification in custom providers
  - Added Auth0 OAuth proxy example demonstrating the new proxy pattern

### Patch Changes

- 1bdec92: Fix OAuth authorize redirect stripping URL path when auth server uses basePath. The `authenticate()` function now preserves the pathname component (e.g. `/api/auth`) instead of reducing the URL to just the origin.

  Setting `color-scheme` to an explicit value ("dark"/"light") on the iframe document root causes browsers to paint an opaque canvas behind the iframe when the widget and host documents use different schemes, making `background-color: transparent` ineffective.

  `McpUseProvider` now accepts a `colorScheme?: boolean` prop (default `false`). When `false`, `ThemeProvider` clears any previously set `color-scheme` inline style, preserving iframe transparency. When `true`, the previous behavior is restored (useful for widgets that need native dark scrollbars or CSS `light-dark()`).

  Theme class (`dark`/`light`) and `data-theme` attribute are unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- 4070f26: Fix OAuth callback URL for inspector mounted at a sub-path

  **mcp-use:** Add `defaultCallbackUrl` prop to `McpClientProvider` so apps mounted at a sub-path (e.g. `/inspector`) can declare the correct OAuth redirect URL once at the provider level instead of passing it to every `addServer` call.

  **inspector:** Pass `defaultCallbackUrl` pointing to `/inspector/oauth/callback`, which is where the React Router (with `basename="/inspector"`) mounts the `OAuthCallback` component. Previously the callback URL defaulted to `/oauth/callback`, causing a blank screen after OAuth because the route was never matched. The "Redirect URL" field has been removed from the authentication dialog — it was never wired to the actual connection and could not be set to a path the inspector would handle.

- 4070f26: Add scopes customization to oauth providers

### Patch Changes

- 4070f26: Fix deployment flow through cli and github connection
- 4070f26: Add missing fields to CustomProviderConfig to match documentation: `userInfoEndpoint`, `jwksUrl`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `mode`, `scopesSupported`, and `audience`. Add `getClientId()`, `getUserInfoEndpoint()`, and `getAudience()` as optional methods on the `OAuthProvider` interface. Replace unsafe `(provider as any).config?.clientId` cast in routes with type-safe `provider.getClientId?.()`.
- 4070f26: Fix Google provider rejecting tool schemas with `propertyNames` keyword.

  `z.record()` causes `@langchain/core` to emit a `propertyNames` field in the JSON Schema output for constrained or enum key types, which Google's Generative AI API rejects. Switching to `z.object({}).catchall()` produces identical runtime behavior while serializing cleanly without `propertyNames`.

## 1.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d7c4df: Add `updateServerMetadata()` to `McpClientProvider` for metadata-only updates that do not trigger a reconnection.

  `updateServer()` continues to disconnect and remount the connection for any connection-affecting change (URL, headers, proxy, transport). `updateServerMetadata(id, { name })` updates the configured display name in place without touching the live connection.

  The Inspector uses this new path to let users set editable server aliases in the connection settings dialog. Alias-only edits no longer cause a full reconnect. All Inspector surfaces (dashboard tiles, server dropdown, header export actions, command palette, server info modal, server icon) now resolve the display name through a shared `getServerDisplayName` utility that prefers user-set aliases over server-reported metadata.

  Also fixes an IME composition issue where pressing `Enter` during Chinese/Japanese/Korean input could accidentally submit the connection form.

## 1.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 7d2112e: Fix middleware-to-tool-handler context propagation and `ctx.auth` typing
  - **Singleton AsyncLocalStorage**: The `context-storage` module now uses `globalThis` to guarantee a single `AsyncLocalStorage` instance even when bundlers split the module into multiple chunks. Previously, dynamic imports from resources, prompts, and proxy handlers could get a different instance, causing `getRequestContext()` to return `undefined` in tool handlers.
  - **Safe Hono context extraction**: Replaced `Object.create(honoContext)` with explicit property extraction in `createEnhancedContext` and `buildHandlerContext`. Hono's `Context` class uses JavaScript private fields (`#req`, `#var`) that cannot be accessed through prototype chains — `Object.create()` caused `TypeError: Cannot read private member #req`. The new approach copies public data (variables from `c.set()`, `req`, `env`) into a plain object.
  - **Auth propagation from middleware to tools**: MCP middleware `ctx.auth` and `ctx.state` values are now forwarded to the enhanced tool context before the callback runs. This ensures data set by HTTP middleware (e.g., bearer token auth via `c.set("auth", ...)`) is accessible as `ctx.auth` in tool handlers.
  - **`ctx.auth` typing**: `ctx.auth` is now typed as `AuthInfo | undefined` (instead of `never`) when OAuth is not configured, allowing `if (!ctx.auth) return error(...)` guards in servers with conditional OAuth.

- 7d2112e: Add `fallback` and `onError` props to ErrorBoundary

  The `ErrorBoundary` component now accepts an optional `fallback` prop (`ReactNode` or `(error: Error) => ReactNode`) for custom error UI, and an `onError` callback for error reporting. When no fallback is provided, the default red error card is shown (backward compatible).

- 7d2112e: Improve MCP middleware and tool typing ergonomics
  - **Typed MCP middleware context**: `server.use("mcp:tools/call", ...)` now narrows `ctx.params` to `{ name: string; arguments?: Record<string, unknown> }` instead of the generic `Record<string, unknown>`. Same for `mcp:resources/read` (typed `uri`) and `mcp:prompts/get` (typed `name` + `arguments`). Wildcard patterns (`mcp:*`) fall back to the base `MiddlewareContext`.
  - **`outputSchema` + response helpers compatibility**: Tools with `outputSchema` can now return `text()`, `mix()`, `markdown()`, and other content helpers without a type error. The callback return type is widened to `Promise<TypedCallToolResult<TOutput> | CallToolResult>`.
  - **Typed `resourceTemplate` params**: `server.resourceTemplate()` now accepts an optional `schema` field (Zod schema). When provided, the callback's `params` argument is narrowed to `z.infer<schema>` instead of `Record<string, any>`, matching how `server.tool()` works.

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- b76df33: Add MCP operation-level middleware via `server.use('mcp:...', fn)`

  Introduces a Hono-style middleware system for intercepting MCP operations (tool calls, resource reads, prompt fetches, and list operations) without touching HTTP routing.

  **Usage:**

  ```typescript
  // Fires for every MCP operation
  server.use("mcp:*", async (ctx, next) => {
    console.log(`→ [${ctx.method}]`, ctx.params);
    const result = await next();
    console.log(`← [${ctx.method}] done`);
    return result;
  });

  // Only fires on tool calls — ctx and next are fully typed automatically
  server.use("mcp:tools/call", async (ctx, next) => {
    if (ctx.auth && !ctx.auth.scopes.includes("tools:*")) {
      throw new Error("Insufficient scope");
    }
    return next();
  });
  ```

  **Patterns:** `mcp:*` (catch-all), `mcp:tools/call`, `mcp:tools/list`, `mcp:resources/read`, `mcp:resources/list`, `mcp:prompts/get`, `mcp:prompts/list`.

  **`MiddlewareContext` fields:** `method`, `params`, `session`, `auth` (populated when OAuth is configured), `state` (per-request `Map` for sharing data between middleware).

  Middleware runs in registration order (onion model), is compatible with HMR, and integrates with the existing OAuth scope system. The `mcp:` prefix clearly distinguishes MCP middleware from HTTP middleware registered via the same `server.use()` call.

- b76df33: feat(tunnel): added ability to start/stop the mcp-use dev tunnel from the inspector
- b76df33: Add `useFiles` React hook with `isSupported` detection and `modelVisible` option for file attachment widgets; add `ModelContext` component and `modelContext` imperative API for injecting model context from the server side.
- b76df33: Upgrade to Vite 8 with Rolldown bundler and fix all test failures

  **Vite 8 upgrade:**
  - Upgrade `vite` from v7.3.x to v8.0.0 across all packages and examples
  - Upgrade `@vitejs/plugin-react` from v5 to v6 (Oxc-based transforms)
  - Migrate `rollupOptions` to `rolldownOptions` in all vite configs
  - Migrate `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` to `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions`
  - Remove deprecated `build.commonjsOptions` (no-op in Vite 8)
  - Switch programmatic `minify: "esbuild"` to `minify: true` (Oxc minifier)
  - Extract `loadConfigFile` from `config.ts` into `config-file.ts` to prevent `require("fs")` leaking into browser bundles

  **Test fixes (35 pre-existing failures):**
  - Telemetry tests: add `vi.resetModules()`, async flush for fire-and-forget tracking, `type: "ai"` on agent mocks, missing adapter methods
  - response-helpers tests: update widget() assertions from `_meta["mcp-use/props"]` to `structuredContent` per SEP-1865
  - HMR tests: add widget config markers, mock `registerPrompt`/`registerResource` on sessions, update error message assertions
  - ai_sdk_compatibility test: fix `StreamEvent` import to `@langchain/core/tracers/log_stream`
  - distributed-stream-routing test: use OS-assigned ports instead of fixed port to eliminate EADDRINUSE race condition
  - browser-react-no-node-deps test: fix `execSync` → `execFileSync` call

  **CI fix:**
  - Quote glob in `test:unit` script (`'tests/integration/**'`) to prevent shell expansion that was causing unit tests to be silently skipped in CI
  - Add missing dev dependencies: `ai`, `morgan`, `@types/morgan`, `express-rate-limit`

### Patch Changes

- b76df33: fix: map elicit result `content` to `data` for Zod validation

  The MCP SDK returns form data in `result.content` per the elicitation spec, but
  `createElicitMethod` was checking `result.data` which is always undefined from
  spec-compliant clients. This caused Zod validation to never run, leaving
  `result.data` as undefined for tool callbacks using `ctx.elicit()` with a Zod
  schema.

  Now reads `result.content` (with fallback to `result.data` for backward
  compatibility) and always maps accepted form data to `result.data` so the typed
  API works correctly. Also fixes the inspector to send `content` instead of
  `data` per the MCP spec.

- b76df33: Fix sse-retry conformance test for React client by passing explicit reconnectionOptions to preserve SDK-level SSE reconnection when autoReconnect is disabled
- b76df33: Fix tool name collisions between resources, prompts, and regular tools in LangChainAdapter. The `reserveName` method now checks whether the prefixed fallback name (`resource_<name>` / `prompt_<name>`) is itself already taken, falling back to a numeric suffix when needed. Prompt names are also now sanitized consistently with resource names.

  - response-helpers tests: update widget() assertions from `_meta["mcp-use/props"]` to `structuredContent` per SEP-1865
  - HMR tests: add widget config markers, mock `registerPrompt`/`registerResource` on sessions, update error message assertions
  - ai_sdk_compatibility test: fix `StreamEvent` import to `@langchain/core/tracers/log_stream`
  - distributed-stream-routing test: use OS-assigned ports instead of fixed port to eliminate EADDRINUSE race condition
  - browser-react-no-node-deps test: fix `execSync` → `execFileSync` call

  **CI fix:**
  - Quote glob in `test:unit` script (`'tests/integration/**'`) to prevent shell expansion that was causing unit tests to be silently skipped in CI
  - Add missing dev dependencies: `ai`, `morgan`, `@types/morgan`, `express-rate-limit`

### Patch Changes

- ed0fadb: Fix Dependabot security alerts by updating vulnerable dependencies across the monorepo. Added pnpm overrides for flatted, tar, hono, @hono/node-server, express-rate-limit, dompurify, minimatch, rollup, form-data, lodash, and other transitive deps. Bumped direct deps: hono to ^4.12.7 (mcp-use, inspector), tar to ^7.5.11 (cli, create-mcp-use-app). Pinned @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to ^1.25.2 in proxy example.
- ed0fadb: fix: TypeGen crash with Zod v4 enum schemas

  `zod-to-ts` assumed Zod v3 internal structure for `ZodEnum` (`_def.values`), which is `undefined` in Zod v4 where enum entries are stored as `_def.entries`. This caused `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` during `mcp-use build` for any project using `z.enum()` with Zod v4. Added v4 fallback paths for `ZodEnum`, `ZodDiscriminatedUnion`, and null guards for `ZodUnion` and `ZodTuple`. Also fixed the CLI reporting success when type generation silently failed.

- ed0fadb: fix: move zod from dependencies to peerDependencies to prevent duplicate type trees

  When users had a different Zod v4 version than the bundled 4.3.5, npm/pnpm installed two copies. TypeScript then performed expensive structural comparisons of deeply recursive Zod types at every `server.tool()` and `ctx.elicit()` boundary, causing type errors or OOM during `mcp-use build`. Making Zod a peerDependency (`^4.0.0`) ensures a single shared instance.

  - Integrated `StreamManager` into the server's notification and request flow so that standalone SSE messages (notifications, server-to-client requests) are routed through Redis Pub/Sub in distributed/load-balanced deployments.
  - Added distributed request/response correlation: server-to-client requests (sampling, elicitation, roots listing) are now correctly routed back to the originating server instance when the client's response POST lands on a different server.
  - Made `RedisStreamManager.create()` idempotent to handle SSE reconnects without duplicate Pub/Sub subscriptions.

### Minor Changes

- 405fac7: Add client-side completion support for prompt arguments and resource template URIs

  This adds the ability for clients to request autocomplete suggestions from MCP servers:
  - New `complete()` method in BaseConnector, MCPSession, and useMcp hook
  - Support for both prompt argument completion and resource template URI completion
  - Fix `resourceTemplates` state population in useMcp (was never populated)
  - New `refreshResourceTemplates()` method in useMcp hook
  - Comprehensive documentation in docs/typescript/client/completion.mdx
  - Integration and unit tests for completion functionality

  The completion feature allows servers to provide static lists or dynamic callbacks for suggesting values based on partial user input, improving the autocomplete experience in client applications.

- 405fac7: feat: ctx.client.user(), MCP Apps capabilities fix, CLI tunnel inspector fix

  ### mcp-use

  **ctx.client.user()** — new per-invocation method on the tool context that extracts
  end-user metadata from `tools/call` `params._meta` (e.g. ChatGPT `openai/*` keys).
  Returns `undefined` on clients that don't send request-level metadata. The `UserContext`
  type is exported from `mcp-use/server`.

  ChatGPT runs a single MCP session for all users of a deployed app — use
  `ctx.client.user()?.subject` to identify the user and `?.conversationId` for the thread.

  **MCP Apps capabilities fix** — patched the MCP SDK's `ClientCapabilitiesSchema` to
  preserve the `extensions` field (previously stripped by Zod's default `$strip` mode),
  so `ctx.client.supportsApps()` now correctly returns `true` for clients that advertise
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`.

  **Session isolation fix** — `findSessionContext` no longer falls back to an arbitrary
  session when the correct one can't be matched, preventing metadata leakage in
  multi-connection scenarios.

  ### @mcp-use/inspector

  The Inspector now advertises MCP Apps support (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`) in its
  `clientInfo.capabilities`. The `capabilities` field on `McpClientProvider.clientInfo`
  is a new provider-level default that applies to all server connections, including those
  restored from localStorage.

  ### @mcp-use/cli

  Fixed: the Inspector's `?autoConnect=` URL now uses the tunnel endpoint when
  `--tunnel` is active, instead of always pointing to `localhost`.

- 405fac7: feat(server): improve mcp server landing page
- 405fac7: feat(widgets): allow sendFollowUp to accept multiple mime types and not just text
- 405fac7: feat(auth): enhance OAuth flow and CORS handling
- 405fac7: Added robust SDK-level server composition and proxying functionality via `MCPServer.proxy()`.

  You can now natively compose multiple disparate MCP servers into a single unified aggregator server. The SDK automatically orchestrates connections, proxies JSON-RPC execution (including tools, prompts, resources, LLM Sampling, Elicitation, and Progress), translates schemas on the fly, prefixes namespaces to prevent collisions, and multiplexes list-changed notifications up to the parent connection.

  ### Example

  ```typescript
  import { MCPServer } from "mcp-use/server";
  const server = new MCPServer({ name: "UnifiedServer", version: "1.0.0" });

  await server.proxy({
    database: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://..."],
    },
    weather: {
      url: "https://weather-mcp.example.com/mcp",
    },
  });

  await server.listen(3000);
  ```

- 405fac7: feat(mcp-use): enhance host information and capabilities handling

### Patch Changes

- 405fac7: Fix TypeScript type errors when passing Express middleware to server.use(). Added proper type definitions to accept both Hono and Express middleware, with Express middleware automatically detected and adapted at runtime.
- 405fac7: feat(mcp-use): enhance reconnection and health check options
- 405fac7: Fix unwanted GET polling when autoReconnect is disabled and spurious duplicate server warning in StrictMode
  - When `autoReconnect: false` is set, the SDK transport's internal SSE reconnection is now also disabled (`maxRetries: 0`), preventing recurring GET requests every ~2 seconds to streamable HTTP servers.
  - `getServer()` now checks `serverConfigs` in addition to the reactive `servers` state, so a `!getServer(id)` guard works correctly in React StrictMode double-mount scenarios. The duplicate `addServer` log has been downgraded to debug level.

The inspector chat tab now sets both to `false`, so the agent only exposes actual MCP tools to the LLM rather than fabricating tool wrappers for resources and prompts.

## 1.17.4

### Patch Changes

- 32b19dc: fix(logs): reduces the amount of noisy logs in the dev server
- 32b19dc: fix: propagate widget resources and resource templates to existing MCP sessions during HMR

  Widget resources added via the file watcher (e.g. creating a new file in `resources/`) were registered in the server wrapper but never pushed to already-connected sessions. This caused "Resource ui://widget/... not found" errors when tools referencing those widgets were executed without reconnecting.
  - Added `propagateWidgetResourcesToSessions()` to push newly registered widget resources and templates to all active sessions independently of tool registration
  - Fixed resource template lookup key mismatch in `addWidgetTool` and `propagateWidgetResourcesToSessions` — templates are stored by name only, not `name:uri`
  - Track propagated resources in `sessionRegisteredRefs` so `syncPrimitive` preserves them across subsequent HMR cycles

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d787ba: Added support for resource template variable completion: resource templates can define callbacks.complete per variable (either a string array or a callback), which is normalized and passed to the SDK so clients can use autocomplete for URI template variables. Includes toResourceTemplateCompleteCallbacks, unit tests, and documentation updates.

  Also publishes completion capabilities in TypeScript SDK MCP servers.

- 3d787ba: Improve reverse proxy support, HMR reliability, and widget handling across the stack.

  ### `mcp-use` (minor)
  - **Custom HTTP route HMR:** Routes registered via `server.get()`, `server.post()`, etc. now support hot module replacement — handlers are hot-swapped without a server restart.
  - **Widget tool protection during HMR:** Widget-registered tools are no longer accidentally removed when `index.ts` HMR sync runs. Tools tagged with `_meta["mcp-use/widget"]` are preserved.
  - **Dynamic widget creation:** The `resources/` directory is auto-created if missing, and the dev server watches for new widgets even if none exist at startup. This enables workflows where widgets are created after the server starts
  - **Vite HMR WebSocket proxy:** A TCP-level WebSocket proxy forwards HMR `upgrade` requests from the main HTTP server to Vite's internal HMR port, enabling hot-reload through reverse proxies (ngrok, E2B, Cloudflare tunnels).
  - **`MCP_URL` environment variable:** Can now be pre-set by users to an external proxy URL. The CLI will not overwrite it, allowing correct widget URLs and HMR WebSocket connections behind reverse proxies.
  - **List-changed notifications on removal:** `sendToolListChanged()`, `sendResourceListChanged()`, and `sendPromptListChanged()` now also fire when items are removed, not just added/updated.
  - **Pre-initialized request handlers:** Tool, prompt, and resource request handlers are pre-registered during session initialization, preventing `Method not found` errors when clients connect to servers that start with zero registrations and add them dynamically.
  - **Widget type default changed:** Widgets now default to `mcpApps` (dual-protocol) instead of `appsSdk`. Only widgets with explicit `appsSdkMetadata` and no `metadata` field use the `appsSdk` type.
  - **`window.__mcpServerUrl` global:** Injected into widget HTML so widgets can dynamically construct API URLs (e.g., `fetch(window.__mcpServerUrl + '/api/data')`).

  - **`MCP_INSPECTOR_FRAME_ANCESTORS` env var:** Controls which origins can embed the inspector in iframes via CSP `frame-ancestors`. Defaults to `*` in development and `'self'` in production.
  - **`mountInspector` configuration options:** Accepts new `devMode` (boolean) and `sandboxOrigin` (string | null) options for controlling sandbox behavior in different deployment environments.
  - **Runtime config injection:** `__MCP_DEV_MODE__` and `__MCP_SANDBOX_ORIGIN__` window globals are injected into the served HTML at runtime, enabling client-side configuration without rebuild.
  - **Localhost URL conversion:** Server-side fetches of widget HTML now convert external proxy URLs to `localhost` to avoid reverse proxy catch-all routes returning SPA HTML instead of Vite-served widget content.
  - **Simplified URL rewriting:** Widget asset URLs are now rewritten to bare server-relative paths that resolve directly through Vite middleware, improving reliability behind reverse proxies.
  - **Fixed infinite re-render loop:** Removed excessive `useEffect` dependencies in `MCPAppsRenderer` that caused continuous re-fetching of widget HTML.

  ### `@mcp-use/cli` (patch)
  - **Respect user-provided `MCP_URL`:** The CLI no longer overwrites `MCP_URL` if already set, allowing users to configure external proxy URLs for reverse proxy setups.

## 1.17.0-canary.1

### Minor Changes

- 31fdb69: Added support for resource template variable completion: resource templates can define callbacks.complete per variable (either a string array or a callback), which is normalized and passed to the SDK so clients can use autocomplete for URI template variables. Includes toResourceTemplateCompleteCallbacks, unit tests, and documentation updates.

  Also publishes completion capabilities in TypeScript SDK MCP servers.

## 1.17.0-canary.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a03ce0: Improve reverse proxy support, HMR reliability, and widget handling across the stack.

  ### `mcp-use` (minor)
  - **Custom HTTP route HMR:** Routes registered via `server.get()`, `server.post()`, etc. now support hot module replacement — handlers are hot-swapped without a server restart.
  - **Widget tool protection during HMR:** Widget-registered tools are no longer accidentally removed when `index.ts` HMR sync runs. Tools tagged with `_meta["mcp-use/widget"]` are preserved.
  - **Dynamic widget creation:** The `resources/` directory is auto-created if missing, and the dev server watches for new widgets even if none exist at startup. This enables workflows where widgets are created after the server starts
  - **Vite HMR WebSocket proxy:** A TCP-level WebSocket proxy forwards HMR `upgrade` requests from the main HTTP server to Vite's internal HMR port, enabling hot-reload through reverse proxies (ngrok, E2B, Cloudflare tunnels).
  - **`MCP_URL` environment variable:** Can now be pre-set by users to an external proxy URL. The CLI will not overwrite it, allowing correct widget URLs and HMR WebSocket connections behind reverse proxies.
  - **List-changed notifications on removal:** `sendToolListChanged()`, `sendResourceListChanged()`, and `sendPromptListChanged()` now also fire when items are removed, not just added/updated.
  - **Pre-initialized request handlers:** Tool, prompt, and resource request handlers are pre-registered during session initialization, preventing `Method not found` errors when clients connect to servers that start with zero registrations and add them dynamically.
  - **Widget type default changed:** Widgets now default to `mcpApps` (dual-protocol) instead of `appsSdk`. Only widgets with explicit `appsSdkMetadata` and no `metadata` field use the `appsSdk` type.
  - **`window.__mcpServerUrl` global:** Injected into widget HTML so widgets can dynamically construct API URLs (e.g., `fetch(window.__mcpServerUrl + '/api/data')`).

  ### `@mcp-use/inspector` (patch)
  - **`MCP_INSPECTOR_FRAME_ANCESTORS` env var:** Controls which origins can embed the inspector in iframes via CSP `frame-ancestors`. Defaults to `*` in development and `'self'` in production.
  - **`mountInspector` configuration options:** Accepts new `devMode` (boolean) and `sandboxOrigin` (string | null) options for controlling sandbox behavior in different deployment environments.
  - **Runtime config injection:** `__MCP_DEV_MODE__` and `__MCP_SANDBOX_ORIGIN__` window globals are injected into the served HTML at runtime, enabling client-side configuration without rebuild.
  - **Localhost URL conversion:** Server-side fetches of widget HTML now convert external proxy URLs to `localhost` to avoid reverse proxy catch-all routes returning SPA HTML instead of Vite-served widget content.

## 1.16.4

### Patch Changes

- ac3e216: fix(mcp-use): release canary versions
- ac3e216: fix(server): HMR tool schema preservation, prompt/resource handler wrappers for CallToolResult conversion, preserve widget resources during HMR, and prompt content normalization

  **HMR Schema Preservation:**
  - Fixed tool schema handling during HMR to use Zod schemas directly instead of converting to params
  - Changed empty schema from `{}` to `z.object({})` to ensure `safeParseAsync` works correctly
  - Preserves full Zod validation capabilities during hot module reload

  **Handler Wrapper Improvements:**
  - Added automatic handler wrapping for prompts and resources to support `CallToolResult` format
  - Prompts now support tool response helpers (`text()`, `object()`, `image()`, etc.) via automatic conversion to `GetPromptResult`
  - Resources now support tool response helpers via automatic conversion to `ReadResourceResult`
  - Applied wrappers in `listen()`, `addPrompt()`, `addResource()`, and `syncPrimitive()` methods

  **Widget Resource Preservation:**
  - Widget resources (`ui://widget/*`) and resource templates are now preserved during HMR
  - Prevents deletion of widget registrations that are only registered on initial load
  - Ensures widgets remain functional across hot reloads

  **HMR Sync Behavior:**
  - Changed `hmr-sync.ts` to prefer `onUpdate` handler over in-place updates
  - Ensures proper handler wrapping for prompts/resources during updates
  - Maintains correct order-preserving update behavior

  **Content Normalization:**
  - Enhanced prompt conversion to handle edge cases:
    - Single content objects without array wrapper
    - Bare content items (result is the content, not wrapped in `content` property)
    - Mixed content type arrays
  - Improved robustness of `CallToolResult` to `GetPromptResult` conversion

  Commits: 116a3be4 (partial)

- ac3e216: fix: ensure pending state is emulated for widgets, reflecting ChatGPT behaviour

  **Inspector Changes:**
  - Updated MCPAppsRenderer and OpenAIComponentRenderer to handle tool output and metadata more effectively, allowing for immediate rendering of widgets even when results are pending
  - Enhanced MessageList and ToolResultRenderer to support immediate rendering of widget tools, improving responsiveness during tool execution
  - Added utility functions for widget detection and pre-rendering capabilities based on tool metadata

  **Server Changes:**
  - Introduced delayed weather tool example (`get-weather-delayed`) in conformance server to demonstrate widget lifecycle management with artificial delays

  **Documentation:**
  - Updated inspector and widget lifecycle testing documentation
  - Enhanced debugging guides for ChatGPT Apps with widget lifecycle testing instructions

  These changes address Issue #930, ensuring widgets can display loading states and update seamlessly upon tool completion.

- ac3e216: chore(deps): upgrade @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to 1.26.0

  **Dependencies:**
  - Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^1.25.3` to `^1.26.0`
  - Applied the same Zod 4 compatibility patch to SDK 1.26.0
  - Removed old SDK 1.25.3 patch file

  **Patch Details:**

  The SDK still requires a patch to fix Zod 4 compatibility in the `zod-compat.js` module. The patch ensures that Zod 4 schemas use their instance methods (`schema.safeParse()`) instead of attempting to call non-existent top-level functions (`z4mini.safeParse()`).

  This is a drop-in replacement upgrade with no breaking changes.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- bcdecd4: feat: Hot Module Reloading (HMR) for MCP server development

  Added HMR support to the `mcp-use dev` command. When you modify your server file (add/remove/update tools, prompts, or resources), changes are applied instantly without restarting the server or dropping client connections.

  **Features:**
  - Tools, prompts, and resources can be added, removed, or updated on-the-fly
  - Connected clients (like the inspector) receive `list_changed` notifications and auto-refresh
  - No changes required to user code - existing server files work as-is
  - Syntax errors during reload are caught gracefully without crashing the server

  **How it works:**
  - CLI uses `chokidar` to watch `src/` directory and root `.ts`/`.tsx` files
  - On file change, the module is re-imported with cache-busting
  - `syncRegistrationsFrom()` diffs registrations and uses the SDK's native `RegisteredTool.update()` and `remove()` methods
  - `list_changed` notifications are sent to all connected sessions

  **Usage:**

  ```bash
  mcp-use dev  # HMR enabled by default
  mcp-use dev --no-hmr  # Disable HMR, use tsx watch instead
  ```

### Patch Changes

- bcdecd4: Add comprehensive test suite for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) functionality

  **Testing Approach:**

  Tests use minimal mocking, focusing on:
  - Real `MCPServer` instances
  - Actual console logs (the developer experience)
  - Direct registration state inspection
  - Light session mocking only for injection tests

  This approach is more robust and less brittle than heavy mocking, as tests verify real behavior and won't break when SDK internals change.

  **Test Coverage:**

  **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/server/hmr.test.ts` - 15 tests):
  - Tool registration (add, update, inject)
  - Prompt registration (add, inject)
  - Resource registration (add, inject)
  - Notification sending (tools/list_changed, prompts/list_changed, resources/list_changed)
  - Entry methods (enable, disable, remove, update)
  - Error handling for injection failures
  - Graceful notification error handling

  **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/hmr-cli.test.ts`):
  - End-to-end file change detection
  - Tool addition via HMR
  - Tool description updates
  - Syntax error handling and recovery
  - Connection persistence during HMR

  **CLI Tests** (`packages/cli/tests/tsx-resolution.test.ts`):
  - tsx binary resolution from package.json bin field
  - Handling string and object bin formats
  - Graceful error handling for missing bin field
  - Preference for 'tsx' entry in object form

  All tests include proper setup/teardown, mocking, and comprehensive assertions.

- bcdecd4: This release includes significant enhancements to OAuth flow handling, server metadata caching, and favicon detection:

  **OAuth Flow Enhancements**
  - Enhanced OAuth proxy to support gateway/proxy scenarios (e.g., Supabase MCP servers)
  - Added automatic metadata URL rewriting from gateway URLs to actual server URLs
  - Implemented resource parameter rewriting for authorize and token requests to use actual server URLs
  - Added WWW-Authenticate header discovery for OAuth metadata endpoints
  - Store and reuse OAuth proxy settings in callback flow for CORS bypass during token exchange
  - Added X-Forwarded-Host support for proper proxy URL construction in dev environments

  **Client Info Support**
  - Added `clientInfo` configuration prop to `McpClientProvider` for OAuth registration
  - Client info (name, version, icons, websiteUrl) is now sent during OAuth registration and displayed on consent pages
  - Supports per-server client info override
  - Inspector now includes client info with branding

  **Server Metadata Caching**
  - Added `CachedServerMetadata` interface for storing server name, version, icons, and other metadata
  - Extended `StorageProvider` interface with optional metadata methods (`getServerMetadata`, `setServerMetadata`, `removeServerMetadata`)
  - Implemented metadata caching in `LocalStorageProvider` and `MemoryStorageProvider`
  - Server metadata is now automatically cached when servers connect and used as initial display while fetching fresh data
  - Improves UX by showing server info immediately on reconnect

  **Inspector Improvements**
  - Added logging middleware to API routes for better debugging
  - Simplified server ID handling by removing redundant URL decoding (searchParams.get() already decodes)
  - Added X-Forwarded-Host header forwarding in Vite proxy configuration
  - Enabled OAuth proxy logging for better visibility

  **Favicon Detection Improvements**
  - Enhanced favicon detector to try all subdomain levels (e.g., mcp.supabase.com → supabase.com → com)
  - Added detection of default vs custom favicons using JSON API response
  - Prefer non-default favicons when available
  - Better handling of fallback cases

  **Other Changes**
  - Updated multi-server example with Supabase OAuth proxy example
  - Added connectionUrl parameter passing for resource field rewriting throughout OAuth flow
  - Improved logging and error messages throughout OAuth flow

- bcdecd4: fix: remove import from "mcp-use" which causes langchain import in server
- bcdecd4: feat(hmr): enhance synchronization for tools, prompts, and resources
  - Implemented a generic synchronization mechanism for hot module replacement (HMR) that updates tools, prompts, and resources in active sessions without removal.
  - Added support for detecting changes in definitions, including renames and updates, ensuring seamless integration during HMR.
  - Improved logging for changes in registrations, enhancing developer visibility into updates during the HMR process.
  - Introduced a new file for HMR synchronization logic, centralizing the handling of updates across different primitive types.

  - `syncRegistrationsFrom()` diffs registrations and uses the SDK's native `RegisteredTool.update()` and `remove()` methods
  - `list_changed` notifications are sent to all connected sessions

  **Usage:**

  ```bash
  mcp-use dev  # HMR enabled by default
  mcp-use dev --no-hmr  # Disable HMR, use tsx watch instead
  ```

### Patch Changes

- dfb30a6: This release includes significant enhancements to OAuth flow handling, server metadata caching, and favicon detection:

  **OAuth Flow Enhancements**
  - Enhanced OAuth proxy to support gateway/proxy scenarios (e.g., Supabase MCP servers)
  - Added automatic metadata URL rewriting from gateway URLs to actual server URLs
  - Implemented resource parameter rewriting for authorize and token requests to use actual server URLs
  - Added WWW-Authenticate header discovery for OAuth metadata endpoints
  - Store and reuse OAuth proxy settings in callback flow for CORS bypass during token exchange
  - Added X-Forwarded-Host support for proper proxy URL construction in dev environments

  **Client Info Support**
  - Added `clientInfo` configuration prop to `McpClientProvider` for OAuth registration
  - Client info (name, version, icons, websiteUrl) is now sent during OAuth registration and displayed on consent pages
  - Supports per-server client info override
  - Inspector now includes client info with branding

  **Server Metadata Caching**
  - Added `CachedServerMetadata` interface for storing server name, version, icons, and other metadata
  - Extended `StorageProvider` interface with optional metadata methods (`getServerMetadata`, `setServerMetadata`, `removeServerMetadata`)
  - Implemented metadata caching in `LocalStorageProvider` and `MemoryStorageProvider`
  - Server metadata is now automatically cached when servers connect and used as initial display while fetching fresh data
  - Improves UX by showing server info immediately on reconnect

  **Inspector Improvements**
  - Added logging middleware to API routes for better debugging
  - Simplified server ID handling by removing redundant URL decoding (searchParams.get() already decodes)
  - Added X-Forwarded-Host header forwarding in Vite proxy configuration
  - Enabled OAuth proxy logging for better visibility

  **Favicon Detection Improvements**
  - Enhanced favicon detector to try all subdomain levels (e.g., mcp.supabase.com → supabase.com → com)
  - Added detection of default vs custom favicons using JSON API response
  - Prefer non-default favicons when available
  - Better handling of fallback cases

  **Other Changes**
  - Updated multi-server example with Supabase OAuth proxy example
  - Added connectionUrl parameter passing for resource field rewriting throughout OAuth flow
  - Improved logging and error messages throughout OAuth flow

## 1.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 198fffd: Add configurable clientInfo support for MCP connection initialization. Clients can now customize how they identify themselves to MCP servers with full metadata including name, title, version, description, icons, and website URL. The clientConfig option is deprecated in favor of deriving it from clientInfo. Default clientInfo is set for mcp-use, inspector sets "mcp-use Inspector" with its own version, and CLI sets "mcp-use CLI".
- 198fffd: feat(inspector): add reconnect functionality for failed connections
  - Introduced a reconnect button in the InspectorDashboard for connections that fail, allowing users to attempt reconnection directly from the UI.
  - Enhanced the dropdown menu to include a reconnect option for failed connections, improving user experience and accessibility.
  - Updated HttpConnector to disable automatic reconnection, shifting the responsibility to higher-level logic for better control over connection management.

- 198fffd: chore: updated docs
- 198fffd: ## Breaking Changes (with Deprecation Warnings)
  - **Renamed `customHeaders` to `headers`**: The `customHeaders` option has been renamed to `headers` across all APIs for better consistency. The old name still works but shows deprecation warnings. Update your code to use `headers` instead.
  - **Renamed `samplingCallback` to `onSampling`**: Callback naming is now more consistent with event handler patterns. The old name still works but shows deprecation warnings.

  ## New Features
  - **Automatic Proxy Fallback**: Added `autoProxyFallback` option to `useMcp` hook and `McpClientProvider`. When enabled (default: `true` in provider), automatically retries failed connections through a proxy when CORS errors or HTTP 4xx errors are detected. This makes connecting to MCP servers much more reliable in browser environments.
  - **Provider-Level Proxy Defaults**: `McpClientProvider` now supports `defaultProxyConfig` and `defaultAutoProxyFallback` props to set proxy configuration for all servers. Individual servers can override these defaults.
  - **OAuth Proxy Support**: Added OAuth request proxying through fetch interceptor in `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`. Configure with `oauthProxyUrl` to route OAuth discovery and token requests through your backend proxy.

  ## Improvements
  - **Enhanced Error Detection**: Better detection of OAuth discovery failures, CORS errors, and connection issues
  - **Smarter Connection Logic**: OAuth provider now always uses the original target URL for OAuth discovery, not the proxy URL
  - **Better Session Management**: Improved session cleanup to avoid noisy warning logs
  - **Type Safety**: Added deprecation notices in TypeScript types for deprecated options
  - **Proxy Header Support**: `proxyConfig` now accepts a `headers` field for custom headers to the proxy

  ## Refactoring
  - **Removed `oauth-helper.ts`** (521 lines): OAuth helper utilities consolidated into `browser-provider.ts`
  - **Removed `react_example.html`**: Outdated example file removed
  - **Major `useMcp` Hook Refactor**: Complete rewrite of connection logic with automatic retry, better error handling, and proxy fallback support

  ## Documentation
  - Updated all client documentation to use new `headers` naming
  - Added comprehensive examples for automatic proxy fallback
  - Updated sampling documentation with new `onSampling` callback name
  - Refreshed React integration guide with provider-based approach

- 53fb670: chore: make broser bundle node js free
- 53fb670: feat: remove Node.js dependencies and improve browser compatibility

  This release removes Node.js-specific dependencies and significantly improves browser compatibility across the mcp-use ecosystem.

  ## Breaking Changes
  - **Logging**: Removed `winston` dependency. The logging system now uses a simple console logger that works in both browser and Node.js environments.

  ## New Features

  ### Browser Runtime Support

  ### LangChain Adapter Export Path Changed

  The LangChain adapter is no longer exported from the main entry point. Import from `mcp-use/adapters` instead:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use";

  // After
  import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use/adapters";
  ```

  **Note:** `@langchain/core` and `langchain` moved from dependencies to optional peer dependencies.

  ## Features

  ### Session Management Architecture with Redis Support

  Implements a pluggable session management architecture enabling distributed deployments with cross-server notifications, sampling, and resource subscriptions.

  **New Interfaces:**
  - `SessionStore` - Pluggable interface for storing session metadata
    - `InMemorySessionStore` (production default)
    - `FileSystemSessionStore` (dev mode default)
    - `RedisSessionStore` (distributed deployments)
  - `StreamManager` - Manages active SSE connections
    - `InMemoryStreamManager` (default)
    - `RedisStreamManager` (distributed via Redis Pub/Sub)

  **Server Configuration:**

  ```typescript
  // Development (default - FileSystemSessionStore for hot reload)
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "dev-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
  });

  // Production distributed (cross-server notifications)
  import { RedisSessionStore, RedisStreamManager } from "mcp-use/server";
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "prod-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    sessionStore: new RedisSessionStore({ client: redis }),
    streamManager: new RedisStreamManager({
      client: redis,
      pubSubClient: pubSubRedis,
    }),
  });
  ```

  **Client Improvements:**
  - Auto-refresh tools/resources/prompts when receiving list change notifications
  - Manual refresh methods: `refreshTools()`, `refreshResources()`, `refreshPrompts()`, `refreshAll()`
  - Automatic 404 handling and re-initialization per MCP spec

  **Convenience Methods:**
  - `sendToolsListChanged()` - Notify clients when tools list changes
  - `sendResourcesListChanged()` - Notify clients when resources list changes
  - `sendPromptsListChanged()` - Notify clients when prompts list changes

  **Development Experience:**
  - FileSystemSessionStore persists sessions to `.mcp-use/sessions.json` in dev mode
  - Sessions survive server hot reloads
  - Auto-cleanup of expired sessions (>24 hours)

  **Deprecated:**
  - `autoCreateSessionOnInvalidId` - Now follows MCP spec strictly (returns 404 for invalid sessions)

  **Learn more:** [Session Management](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/session-management)

  ### Favicon Support for Widgets

  Added favicon configuration for widget pages:

  ```typescript
  const server = createMCPServer({
    name: "my-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    favicon: "favicon.ico", // Path relative to public/ directory
  });
  ```

  - Favicon automatically served at `/favicon.ico` for entire server domain
  - CLI build process includes favicon in widget HTML pages
  - Long-term caching (1 year) for favicon assets

  **Learn more:** [UI Widgets](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/ui-widgets) and [Server Configuration](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/configuration)

  ### CLI Client Support

  Added dedicated CLI client support for better command-line integration and testing.

  **Learn more:** [CLI Client](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/client/cli)

  ### Enhanced Session Methods
  - `callTool()` method now defaults args to an empty object
  - New `requireSession()` method for reliable session retrieval

  ## Improvements

  ### Widget Build System
  - Automatic cleanup of stale widget directories in `.mcp-use` folder
  - Dev mode watches for widget file/directory deletions and cleans up build artifacts

  ### Dependency Management
  - Added support for Node >= 18
  - Added CommonJS module support

  ### Documentation & Metadata
  - Updated agent documentation and method signatures
  - Added repository metadata to package.json

  ## Fixes

  ### Widget Fixes
  - Fixed widget styling isolation - widgets no longer pick up mcp-use styles
  - Fixed favicon URL generator for proper asset resolution

  ### React Router Migration

  Migrated from `react-router-dom` to `react-router` for better compatibility and reduced bundle size.

  **Learn more:** [useMcp Hook](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/client/usemcp)

  ### Session & Transport Fixes
  - Fixed transport cleanup when session becomes idle
  - Fixed agent access to resources and prompts

### Minor Changes

- 0262b5c: feat: pluggable session management architecture with Redis support

  Implements a split architecture for session management, separating serializable metadata storage from active SSE stream management. This enables distributed deployments where notifications, sampling, and resource subscriptions work across multiple server instances.

  ## Session Management Architecture

  ### New Interfaces
  - **SessionStore**: Pluggable interface for storing serializable session metadata (client capabilities, log level, timestamps). Implementations:
    - `InMemorySessionStore` (production default) - Fast, in-memory storage
    - `FileSystemSessionStore` (dev mode default) - File-based persistence for hot reload support
    - `RedisSessionStore` - Persistent, distributed storage for production clusters
  - **StreamManager**: Pluggable interface for managing active SSE connections. Implementations:
    - `InMemoryStreamManager` (default) - Single server only
    - `RedisStreamManager` - Distributed via Redis Pub/Sub for cross-server notifications
  - **SessionMetadata**: New serializable interface for session metadata that can be stored externally
  - **SessionData**: Extends SessionMetadata with non-serializable runtime objects (transport, server, context)

  ### Server Configuration

  Added new `ServerConfig` options:
  - `sessionStore?: SessionStore` - Custom session metadata storage backend
  - `streamManager?: StreamManager` - Custom stream manager for active SSE connections

  Deprecated:
  - `autoCreateSessionOnInvalidId` - Now follows MCP spec strictly (returns 404 for invalid sessions). Use `sessionStore` with persistent backend for session persistence.

  Enhanced:
  - `stateless` mode now auto-detects based on client `Accept` header (supports k6, curl, and other HTTP-only clients)

  ### Client Improvements
  - Added automatic 404 handling and re-initialization in `SseConnectionManager` and `StreamableHttpConnectionManager` per MCP spec
  - Deprecated `sse` transport type in React types (use `http` or `auto`)
  - **Auto-refresh on list changes**: `useMcp` hook now automatically refreshes tools, resources, and prompts when receiving `notifications/tools/list_changed`, `notifications/resources/list_changed`, or `notifications/prompts/list_changed`
  - Added manual refresh methods: `refreshTools()`, `refreshResources()`, `refreshPrompts()`, and `refreshAll()` to `useMcp` return value
  - Inspector UI now automatically updates when tools/resources/prompts change during development

  ### Notification Enhancements

  Added convenience methods:
  - `sendToolsListChanged()` - Notify clients when tools list changes
  - `sendResourcesListChanged()` - Notify clients when resources list changes
  - `sendPromptsListChanged()` - Notify clients when prompts list changes

  ### Usage Examples

  ```typescript
  // Development (default - FileSystemSessionStore for hot reload support)
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "dev-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    // Sessions automatically persist to .mcp-use/sessions.json
    // Survives server restarts during hot reload!
  });

  // Production single instance (persistent sessions)
  import { RedisSessionStore } from "mcp-use/server";
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "prod-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    sessionStore: new RedisSessionStore({ client: redis }),
  });

  // Production distributed (cross-server notifications)
  import { RedisSessionStore, RedisStreamManager } from "mcp-use/server";
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "prod-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    sessionStore: new RedisSessionStore({ client: redis }),
    streamManager: new RedisStreamManager({
      client: redis,
      pubSubClient: pubSubRedis,
    }),
  });
  ```

  ### Development Experience Improvements
  - **FileSystemSessionStore** (new): Sessions automatically persist to `.mcp-use/sessions.json` in development mode
  - Eliminates the need for clients to re-initialize after server hot reloads
  - Auto-selected in dev mode (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`), can be overridden via `sessionStore` config
  - Supports session cleanup on load (removes expired sessions older than 24 hours)

  ### Testing & Documentation
  - Added comprehensive session management architecture documentation
  - Added Redis integration guide and verification
  - Added scale testing infrastructure (load testing, chaos testing, longevity tests)
  - Added unit tests for session stores and stream managers

  ### Breaking Changes

  None - all changes are backward compatible. Default behavior uses in-memory implementations, maintaining existing functionality.

## 1.11.0-canary.8

### Minor Changes

- 3945a10: **Breaking Changes:**
  - LangChain adapter no longer exported from main entry point. Import from `mcp-use/adapters` instead:

    ```ts
    // Before
    import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use";

    // After
    import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use/adapters";
    ```

  - Moved `@langchain/core` and `langchain` from dependencies to optional peer dependencies

  **Features:**
  - Added favicon support for widget pages. Configure via `favicon` option in `ServerConfig`:
    ```ts
    const server = createMCPServer({
      name: "my-server",
      version: "1.0.0",
      favicon: "favicon.ico", // Path relative to public/ directory
    });
    ```
  - Favicon automatically served at `/favicon.ico` for entire server domain
  - CLI build process now includes favicon in widget HTML pages

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ec11cd: ## Breaking Changes
  - **Server API**: Renamed `createMCPServer()` factory function to `MCPServer` class constructor. The factory function is still available for backward compatibility but new code should use `new MCPServer({ name, ... })`.
  - **Session API**: Replaced `session.connector.tools`, `session.connector.callTool()`, etc. with direct methods: `session.tools`, `session.callTool()`, `session.listResources()`, `session.readResource()`, etc.
  - **OAuth Environment Variables**: Standardized OAuth env vars to `MCP_USE_OAUTH_*` prefix (e.g., `AUTH0_DOMAIN` → `MCP_USE_OAUTH_AUTH0_DOMAIN`).

  ## New Features
  - **Client Capabilities API**: Added `ctx.client.can()` and `ctx.client.capabilities()` to check client capabilities in tool callbacks.
  - **Session Notifications**: Added `ctx.sendNotification()` and `ctx.sendNotificationToSession()` for sending notifications from tool callbacks.
  - **Session Info**: Added `ctx.session.sessionId` to access current session ID in tool callbacks.
  - **Resource Template Flat Structure**: Resource templates now support flat structure with `uriTemplate` directly on definition (in addition to nested structure).
  - **Resource Template Callback Signatures**: Resource template callbacks now support multiple signatures: `()`, `(uri)`, `(uri, params)`, `(uri, params, ctx)`.
  - **Type Exports**: Added exports for `CallToolResult`, `Tool`, `ToolAnnotations`, `PromptResult`, `GetPromptResult` types.

  ## Improvements
  - **Type Inference**: Enhanced type inference for resource template callbacks with better overload support.
  - **Client Capabilities Tracking**: Server now captures and stores client capabilities during initialization.
  - **Session Methods**: Added convenience methods to `MCPSession` for all MCP operations (listResources, readResource, subscribeToResource, listPrompts, getPrompt, etc.).
  - **Documentation**: Major documentation refactoring and restructuring for better organization.

- 6ec11cd: feat: added support for elicitation in inspector
- 6ec11cd: ## Elicitation Support

  Added comprehensive elicitation support following MCP specification, enabling servers to request user input through clients.

  ### New Features
  - **Simplified API**: `ctx.elicit(message, zodSchema)` and `ctx.elicit(message, url)` with automatic mode detection
  - **Form Mode**: Collect structured data with Zod schema validation and full TypeScript type inference
  - **URL Mode**: Direct users to external URLs for sensitive operations (OAuth, credentials)
  - **Server-Side Validation**: Automatic Zod validation of returned data with clear error messages
  - **Client Support**: Added `elicitationCallback` to MCPClient and `onElicitation` to React `useMcp` hook
  - **Type Safety**: Return types automatically inferred from Zod schemas
  - **Configurable Timeout**: Optional timeout parameter (default: no timeout, waits indefinitely like sampling)

  ### Improvements
  - Reuses official SDK's `toJsonSchemaCompat` for Zod → JSON Schema conversion
  - Automatic `elicitationId` generation for URL mode requests
  - 5-minute default timeout for user interactions
  - Defense-in-depth validation (client optional, server required)
  - Backwards compatible with verbose API

  ### Documentation
  - Added `/typescript/server/elicitation` - Server-side usage guide
  - Updated `/typescript/client/elicitation` - Client-side implementation guide
  - Added to docs navigation
  - Comprehensive examples with validation scenarios

  ### Testing
  - **Unit Tests**: 14 tests covering Zod conversion and validation (`tests/unit/server/elicitation.test.ts`)
  - **Integration Tests**: 14 tests covering full client-server flow (`tests/integration/elicitation.test.ts`)
  - **Manual Tests**: Basic functionality and comprehensive validation test suites
  - **Total**: 28 automated tests + manual test suites
  - **Status**: All tests passing ✅

  ### Examples
  - Created `examples/server/elicitation-test/` with 4 working tools
  - Included basic functionality test client
  - Included comprehensive validation test client (7 scenarios)
  - Added timeout configuration examples
  - All examples working

### Minor Changes

- 96e4097: ## Breaking Changes
  - **Server API**: Renamed `createMCPServer()` factory function to `MCPServer` class constructor. The factory function is still available for backward compatibility but new code should use `new MCPServer({ name, ... })`.
  - **Session API**: Replaced `session.connector.tools`, `session.connector.callTool()`, etc. with direct methods: `session.tools`, `session.callTool()`, `session.listResources()`, `session.readResource()`, etc.
  - **OAuth Environment Variables**: Standardized OAuth env vars to `MCP_USE_OAUTH_*` prefix (e.g., `AUTH0_DOMAIN` → `MCP_USE_OAUTH_AUTH0_DOMAIN`).

  ## New Features
  - **Client Capabilities API**: Added `ctx.client.can()` and `ctx.client.capabilities()` to check client capabilities in tool callbacks.
  - **Session Notifications**: Added `ctx.sendNotification()` and `ctx.sendNotificationToSession()` for sending notifications from tool callbacks.
  - **Session Info**: Added `ctx.session.sessionId` to access current session ID in tool callbacks.
  - **Resource Template Flat Structure**: Resource templates now support flat structure with `uriTemplate` directly on definition (in addition to nested structure).
  - **Resource Template Callback Signatures**: Resource template callbacks now support multiple signatures: `()`, `(uri)`, `(uri, params)`, `(uri, params, ctx)`.
  - **Type Exports**: Added exports for `CallToolResult`, `Tool`, `ToolAnnotations`, `PromptResult`, `GetPromptResult` types.

  ## Improvements
  - **Type Inference**: Enhanced type inference for resource template callbacks with better overload support.
  - **Client Capabilities Tracking**: Server now captures and stores client capabilities during initialization.
  - **Session Methods**: Added convenience methods to `MCPSession` for all MCP operations (listResources, readResource, subscribeToResource, listPrompts, getPrompt, etc.).
  - **Documentation**: Major documentation refactoring and restructuring for better organization.

### Minor Changes

- 7e4dd9b: ## Features
  - **Notifications**: Added bidirectional notification support between clients and servers. Clients can register notification handlers and servers can send targeted or broadcast notifications. Includes automatic handling of `list_changed` notifications per MCP spec.
  - **Sampling**: Implemented LLM sampling capabilities allowing MCP tools to request completions from connected clients. Clients can provide a `samplingCallback` to handle sampling requests, enabling tools to leverage client-side LLMs.

  - **Inspector Enhancements**: Added notifications tab with real-time notification display and server capabilities modal showing supported MCP capabilities.

  ## Improvements
  - **Session Management**: Refactored HTTP transport to reuse sessions across requests instead of creating new transports per request. Added session tracking with configurable idle timeout (default 5 minutes) and automatic cleanup. Sessions now maintain state across multiple requests, enabling targeted notifications to specific clients.
  - Enhanced HTTP connector with improved notification handling and sampling support
  - Added roots support in connectors and session API (`setRoots()`, `getRoots()`) for better file system integration
  - Added session event handling API (`session.on("notification")`) for registering notification handlers

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 26e1162: Migrated mcp-use server from Express to Hono framework to enable edge runtime support (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Supabase Edge Functions). Added runtime detection for Deno/Node.js environments, Connect middleware adapter for compatibility, and `getHandler()` method for edge deployment. Updated dependencies: added `hono` and `@hono/node-server`, moved `connect` and `node-mocks-http` to optional dependencies, removed `express` and `cors` from peer dependencies.

  Added Supabase deployment documentation and example templates to create-mcp-use-app for easier edge runtime deployment.

- 26e1162: ### MCPAgent Message Detection Improvements (fix #446)

  Fixed issue where `agent.run()` returned "No output generated" even when valid output was produced, caused by messages not being AIMessage instances after serialization/deserialization across module boundaries. Added robust message detection helpers (`_isAIMessageLike`, `_isHumanMessageLike`, `_isToolMessageLike`) that handle multiple message formats (class instances, plain objects with `type`/`role` properties, objects with `getType()` methods) to support version mismatches and different LangChain message formats. Includes comprehensive test coverage for message detection edge cases.

  ### Server Base URL Fix

  Fixed server base URL handling to ensure proper connection and routing in edge runtime environments, resolving issues with URL construction and path resolution.

  ### Inspector Enhancements

  Improved auto-connection logic with better error handling and retry mechanisms. Enhanced resource display components and OpenAI component renderer for better reliability and user experience. Updated connection context management for more robust multi-server support.

  ### Supabase Deployment Example

  Added complete Supabase deployment example with Deno-compatible server implementation, deployment scripts, and configuration templates to `create-mcp-use-app` for easier edge runtime deployment.

  ### React Hook and CLI Improvements

  Enhanced `useMcp` hook with better error handling and connection state management for browser-based MCP clients. Updated CLI with improved server URL handling and connection management.

  - Added PostHog integration in the docs.
  - Improved error handling throughout the Chat tab and connection process.
  - Fixed Apps SDK widget rendering with proper parameter passing.
